        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- <p>Hi, I'm Kat! I recently graduated with an MSc in Computer Science, focusing on programming, and I'm excited to pivot into a career as a Full-Stack Developer. Before diving into the world of programming, I spent over a decade in teaching, international relations, and customer service. These experiences helped me build strong interpersonal connections and problem-solving abilities.</p>
        <p>Working and studying in various countries exposed me to different cultures and viewpoints, which has given me a unique perspective and a deep appreciation for diversity. I'm eager to bring this global outlook, along with my technical skills in Python, Java, SQL, HTML/CSS and JavaScript, to the dynamic field of software development.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for creating dynamic, responsive web and mobile applications. With a strong foundation in programming and a continuous learning mindset, I'm ready to contribute meaningfully to any development team. </p>>
        <p>One day, I hope to create my own video game, blending my love for storytelling and technology, though I’m still learning the ropes with tools like Unity and Unreal Engine.
        I also enjoy working on personal apps and websites in my free time, such as  food and bill trackers (in progress, eventually) and my mobile gardening app (currently in progress), which blends my hobby for gardening with my new love of software engineering in a handy Flutter app I' building to plan garden tasks.
